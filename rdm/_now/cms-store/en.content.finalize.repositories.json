They ensure&nbsp;<strong>long-term availability of data</strong>, and generally provide&nbsp;<strong>persistent identifiers</strong>&nbsp;(mainly DOI) for data citation.</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px4\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\">Repositories can be general (accepting a wide range of data from&nbsp;<em>any&nbsp;</em>scientist), institutional (also often content covering a wide range of scientific fields, but data upload contingent on institutional affiliation) or discipline-specific.</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\"><strong>Discipline-specific repositories</strong>&nbsp;are recommended, as they provide more opportunities (but also obligations) to document data according to needs and standards of a scientific field. Data are also more likely to be discovered by other scientists working in the same or closely related fields. Various journals/publishers have <strong>lists of recommended repositories</strong>:</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\"><span class=\"body-link\"><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Scientific Data (Springer Nature) recommended data repositories</a></span></div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\"><span class=\"body-link\"><a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/recommended-repositories\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">PLoS ONE</a></span>&nbsp;(applying to all PLOS journals)</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\"><span class=\"body-link\"><a href=\"https://peerj.com/about/policies-and-procedures/#data-materials-sharing\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">PeerJ Data and Materials Sharing</a></span></div>\n"}
