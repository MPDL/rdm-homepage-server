{"key":"en.content.finalize.licences","value":"<div class=\"headline-main\">Data licences</div>\n\n<div class=\"headline-sub\">Clarify conditions of data (re-)use</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-teaser\">Published research data have limited (or no) potential for reuse if users do not know what they can do with the data, subject to which conditions. It is therefore crucial to assign a licence to a dataset. Community standards and good scientific practice should still be observed even if not enforced by licences.</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-headline\">Creative Commons</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\"><span class=\"body-link\"><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Commons licences</a>&nbsp;</span>were initially designed for cultural material, but in the latest version 4 are also suitable for scientific data. While not specifically addressing characteristics of (scientific) data, they are widely known and adopted, hence users will be familiar with their meaning. All licences come with a short summary (in many languages) understandable without legal background, as well as the full licence text.</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"blue body-text info-box\">Recommended licences are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY</a>&nbsp;(Attribution) or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CC0</a>&nbsp;(Public Domain, No Rights Reserved). CC BY obliges re-users to give credit to data producers (without implying endorsement). CC0 doesn&rsquo;t include such a formal obligation, but good scientific practice still requires giving due credit.</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\">Other conditions can be imposed but aren&rsquo;t recommended for various reasons: SA (ShareAlike) imposes that works derived from data are distributed under the same licence (&ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;) &ndash; this can pose problems if data from various sources provided with different licences are aggregated. NC (NonCommercial) prohibits commercial use, but it can be difficult to define what&nbsp;exactly&nbsp;represents commercial (re-)use.&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-headline\">Open Data Commons</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\"><span class=\"body-link\"><a href=\"https://opendatacommons.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Open Data Commons licences</a></span>&nbsp;were designed specifically for data, one key feature is that different licences can be applied to a database as a whole and to its content &ndash; this is relevant for example if an image database compiles images from various sources with some images copyrighted. These licences also have human-readable summaries as well as full legal text.</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\">Analogous to above-mentioned CC licenses are <span class=\"body-link\"><a href=\"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">ODC-By</a></span> (Open Data Commons Attribution Licence)&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class=\"body-link\"><a href=\"https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">PDDL</a></span>&nbsp;(Public Domain Dedication and Licence). Again, it isn&rsquo;t recommended to use a ShareAlike licence. Open Data Commons licences are strictly spoken preferable, but not as widely used as CC licences.</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-headline\">Other licences</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\"><span class=\"body-link\"><a href=\"http://www.govdata.de/lizenzen\">Datenlizenz Deutschland</a></span>&nbsp;was created for administrative government data. While consistent with international open data standards and having licence text in both German and English, an international audience may not be familiar with these licences.</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\">All mentioned licences allow open re-use of data, subject to certain conditions. Some use cases may require different licences, e.g. allowing commercial re-use subject to payment of a fee or restricting access to (personal) data. The Edmond repository only accepts open access data.</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\">&nbsp;</div>\n"}
