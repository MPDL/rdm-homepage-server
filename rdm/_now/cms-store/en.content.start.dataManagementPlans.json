Costs for data management (software, hardware, technical expertise) can often be included in research proposals. Even without a formal obligation, you may do yourself a favor creating a &ldquo;private&rdquo; data management plan.</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"blue body-text info-box\">Data management plans shouldn&rsquo;t be viewed as bureaucratic hurdles or &ldquo;compliance tick boxes&rdquo;, but as an integral part of research practice. They are (or should be)&nbsp;<strong>living documents</strong>&nbsp;that might require revisions or updates as research progresses and data are acquired and processed: Details become clear, initial plans may change, unforeseen collaboration opportunities could arise, &hellip;. .</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\"><strong>Data management plans generally cover the following aspects:</strong></div>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Data description and collection</strong>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Which data will be generated (types, formats, volume)? Types could include e.g. numeric, textual, image, audio, video, &hellip; . Formats are often indicated by the filename extension. Proprietary formats (created by scientific instruments and/or specific software applications) should be converted to open and standard formats at some stage. Volume can be described in terms of number of files as well as total file size.</li>\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Will the project re-use existing data? If not, has this possibility been explored?</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Documentation and metadata</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">What is needed for others (as much as possible, also beyond your own scientific field) to find, understand and potentially reuse your data? Documentation might include definition of variables, details of methodology, approaches to quality control, &hellip; .</li>\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Metadata should be comprehensive and follow community standards whenever available.</li>\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">File organization and nomenclature might be described in this section.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Storage and backup</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Where will data be stored during the project? Is sufficient storage available? How, and how frequently will data be backed up? Multiple backups at different locations are strongly recommended.</li>\n\t\t<li>How are data generated in the field transferred to more secure locations?</li>\n\t\t<li>How will data be recovered in case of incidents?</li>\n\t\t<li>How will data be protected to prevent unauthorized access, particularly for sensitive data (e.g. containing personal information)?</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Legal and ethical requirements</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>In case of personal data, how is compliance with applicable regulations and laws (e.g. GDPR) assured?</li>\n\t\t<li>Are there other restrictions on sharing data, such as intellectual property rights or plans to seek for patents?</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Data sharing and long-term preservation</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Which data will be made freely available, and when? How will potential reusers find out that, and where/how datasets are available? Will data be deposited in a repository, or shared by other means?</li>\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Will data be assigned with persistent identifiers? Will licenses clarify conditions of reuse?</li>\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Will access to data be limited, e.g. restricted to certain communities or subject to data sharing agreements?</li>\n\t\t<li>Also for data that aren&rsquo;t shared: How is long-term preservation (beyond the lifetime of the project) assured, and for how long?</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Responsibilities and resources</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Who will be responsible for data management, implementing the DMP and updating it as needed? This could be one or several named person(s) or an institution. Different parts of the data management process may be spread over several roles.</li>\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">How are responsibilities defined and/or split in collaborative research projects?</li>\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Which resources (e.g. software, hardware, technical expertise) are required for data management? Which costs are involved, and how will these be covered?</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\">This information is often preceded by administrative data (e.g. funder, project, grant reference number, principal investigator, version of DMP). The level of detail appropriate or required in DMPs will differ between projects and scientific fields, particularly regarding data documentation.</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-headline\">Tools for creation of data management plans</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-head-comment\">&quot;You don&#39;t have to re-invent the wheel!&quot;</div>\n\n<div class=\"distance px8\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<p><strong>Two online tools are available (registration required):</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"distance px4\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"body-text\"><span class=\"body-link\"><a href=\"https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">DMPonline</a></span>&nbsp;by the British Digital Curation Centre (DCC).
